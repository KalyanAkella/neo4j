module Neo4j
  #
  # All modifying operations that work with the node space must be wrapped in a transaction. Transactions are thread confined.
  # Neo4j does not implement true nested transaction, instead it uses flat nested transactions
  # see http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Flat_nested_transactions
  #
  class Transaction

    # Starts a new Neo4j Transaction
    # Returns a Java Neo4j Transaction object
    # See http://api.neo4j.org/current/org/neo4j/graphdb/Transaction.html
    #
    # Example:
    #  tx = Neo4j::Transaction.new
    #  # modify something
    #  tx.success
    #  tx.finish
    def self.new(instance = Neo4j.started_db)
      instance.begin_tx
    end

    # Runs a block in a Neo4j transaction
    #
    # Many operations on neo requires an transaction. You will get much better performance if
    # one transaction is wrapped around several neo operation instead of running one transaction per
    # neo operation.
    # If one transaction is already running then a 'placebo' transaction will be created.
    # Performing a finish on a placebo transaction will not finish the 'real' transaction.
    #
    # ==== Params
    # ::yield:: the block to be performed in one transaction
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #  include 'neo4j'
    #
    #  Neo4j::Transaction.run {
    #    node = PersonNode.new
    #  }
    #
    # You have also access to transaction object
    #
    #   Neo4j::Transaction.run { |t|
    #     # something failed
    #     t.failure # will cause a rollback
    #   }

    # If an exception occurs inside the block the transaction will rollback automatically
    #
    # ==== Returns
    # The value of the evaluated provided block
    #
    def self.run # :yield: block that will be executed in a transaction
      raise ArgumentError.new("Expected a block to run in Transaction.run") unless block_given?
